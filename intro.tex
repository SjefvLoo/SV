\section{Introduction}
\todo{Robin: This is an introduction to the assignment, we should make it an introduction to our report instead.}
In Veldhoven you find the company ASML (\url{www.asml.com}).
This company makes wafer scanners.
Wafer scanners project images on silicon wafers with nano meter precision.
This document will describe a (simplified) controller for such a scanner.
A scanner contains multiple chucks on which the scanner does different things.
The scanner will move each wafer from chuck to chuck in order to project images on the wafers.
Wafers will be processed in lots in which each lot has a certain recipe.
