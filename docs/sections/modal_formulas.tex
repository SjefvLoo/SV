\section{Modal Formulas}\label{sec:modal_formulas}
The requirements are converted to modal formula's, the implementation of these formula's (as \textit{mcf} files) can be found in appendix \ref{sec:mcf}. In order to speed up the verification an auxilary formula is made which check if \textit{RMoveFromTo} and \textit{RIdle} are only called with permitted parameters (as defined in set $M$). By verifying this seperately other formula's only need to consider the allowed parameter combinations and not every possible parameter combination.
