\section{Modal Formulas}\label{sec:modal_formulas}
The requirements are converted to modal formulas.
The precise formulation of these modal formulas in mcf format can be found in appendix~\ref{sec:mcf}.

To ease the process of verifying the model an auxiliary requirement is introduced.
This requirement will be referred to as \textit{Auxiliary 1} and can be found in appendix~\ref{sec:aux1}.
The requirement states that only valid robot moves are done.
That is, the tuples specified in $M$ as defined by Equation~\ref{eq:valid-moves} on page~\pageref{eq:valid-moves}.
Under the assumption that this requirement is fulfilled, one only needs to consider the valid moves in the other requirements instead of all possible move combinations.
