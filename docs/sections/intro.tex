\section{Introduction}
This document contains a simplified design for a controller that handles the processing of a lot of wafers.
The main goal of this document is to proof that the design of the controller adheres to the requirements that have been decided on in advance.

First, a textual description of the system is given, followed by a list of facts about the system. This can be found in section~\ref{sec:system_desc}.
In section~\ref{sec:requirements} a list of requirements is given, which have been derived from the system description. These requirements are described in a natural language.
Next, in section~\ref{sec:ext_interactions} the interactions between the external components and the controller are identified.
In section~\ref{sec:req2int} the requirements described in section~\ref{sec:requirements} are translated into terms of these interactions.
Using modal $\mu$-calculus the requirements are converted to modal formulas as described in section~\ref{sec:modal_formulas}.
These modal formulas can then be used by mCRL2 to validate a designed controller.
In section~\ref{sec:results} one can read about which requirements have been validated an which requirements have not been validated.

In appendix~\ref{sec:model} one can find the model we designed and validated.
This model has been defined in the mCRL2 format.
Appendix~\ref{sec:mcf} provides all the modal formulas written in mcf format.
These files can be used to validate the design using the mCRL2 tool set.
