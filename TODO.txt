Teacher:

Requirement 5:
Note: Move true* before the quantifiers makes checing far more efficient

Requirement 12:
Strikethrough !Projectwafer
Strikethrough (X(rec,even))
Note: Makes the formula a little shorter

Requirement 13:
Note for line 40-63: Use a set

Requirement 14:
Note: This check is not enough


Marc:
TrayDone?
Requirement 3 has true* also inside quantifier

I tried fixing 3 & 5, but it looks like grammar does not permit state formulas
inside quantifiers which are inside a box.

The grammar says:
'[' RegFrm ']' StateFrm

pick for RegFrm
'forall' VarsDeclList '.' ActFrm

For ActFrm I can only have a list of actions
